//! HTTP/OpenMetrics metrics surface.
//!
//! `/metrics` over plain TCP, encoded by `prometheus-client` as
//! [OpenMetrics text](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#text-format):
//! counter samples carry `_total`, the body closes with `# EOF`.
//!
//! Declarations live here rather than in a mutable metric registry: values are
//! already atomics elsewhere in the pipeline, so a scrape encodes one owned
//! [`MetricsSnapshot`] through a [`Collector`].
//!
//! Registry is `Arc`-cloneable: daemon's main loop writes at status-tick
//! cadence, HTTP server reads a snapshot per request. Endpoint is read-only by
//! design (no `/quit`, no admin verbs); operator actions stay on the CLI.
