//! Descriptor capture at catalog-commit boundaries.
//!
//! Runs inside the pump's publication hold, after shadow applies through the
//! boundary's `next_lsn` and before the commit record forwards to the
//! worker: capture observes exactly the commit's catalog state, its batch is
//! durable before any successor byte publishes, and drain finds events
//! already attached to the xact.
//!
//! Replay-from-log first: a boundary whose batch is already stored derives
//! its events from the stored entries against each oid's historical
//! predecessor — no SQL, deterministic across restarts. Boundaries at or
//! below the seed's `covered_through` are baked into the seed snapshot and
//! skip entirely. A miss queries shadow; the returned replay position must
//! equal `next_lsn` (nothing past the commit has published during the hold),
//! anything else means the log lost coverage — fatal.
//!
//! Statistics-only commits leave relation definitions unchanged, so skip
//! replay waits and save an empty batch. Restart loses evidence that only
//! statistics changed. Replay saved batch to avoid querying shadow after
//! it has replayed past this commit
//!
//! valid_from bias-early: a descriptor is a backward-compatible reader of
//! older tuples, never the reverse. Rotated filenode → the rfn's
//! `XLOG_SMGR_CREATE` marker (before any page write); in-place change → the
//! oid's first pg_class touch in the xact; fallback the xact tree's first
//! catalog touch. Dropped tombstones at `next_lsn`.
//!
//! Bias-early holds when the final descriptor provably reads the whole
//! dirty interval, and when the only drift is one `catalog::compat` calls
//! benign — declared shape changed, every byte reads the same. A physically
//! unproven in-place transition publishes an `Ambiguity` over
//! `[first_touch, next_lsn)` instead and lands its `Present` at `next_lsn`:
//! post-commit rows decode, interval rows fail closed per record at the
//! drain ([`crate::xact::xact_buffer::resolve_stash`]). One interval per
//! identity key (rfn, oid) so both lookup paths see the same fence.
//! Rotations skip the check: the rewrite emits final-layout tuples and
//! superseded-generation rows retire with the old rfn. Fresh generations
//! have no covered predecessor to compare.
//!
//! Command boundaries ([`crate::record::BoundaryKind::Command`]) sample the
//! same relations mid-transaction, off the writing transaction's own
//! uncommitted rows, into
//! [`PendingCatalog`]. Nothing there
//! is durable until this xact's commit folds those slots into the batch at
//! their own positions, which is also what shrinks the fence: promoted slots
//! are exact shapes at exact positions, so the ambiguity survives only over
//! the run before the first of them, and rows past it decode.
