//! Source timeline crossing.
//!
//! A promoted source ends the branch walshadow reads at a fork point `F` and
//! continues on a descendant. The walsender says so by closing COPY on a
//! historic timeline; from there one owner walks the stream across, in an order
//! chosen so a restart at any point sees one branch rather than two:
//!
//! ```text
//! ancestor ends at F ─► prove lineage ─► [barrier: pipeline drains to F] ─►
//!   publish history ─► request descendant at fork segment start ─►
//!   verify repeated prefix ─► commit the resume position ─►
//!   transition WalStream ─► advertise to shadow ─► resume
//! ```
//!
//! The commit is the hinge. Everything before it is reversible: the stream is
//! still the ancestor's at `F`, so a failure or a kill re-crosses from where the
//! branch ended. Everything after it is the descendant's, and the barrier is
//! what earns that — with nothing in flight below `F`, the resume floor moves to
//! the fork segment's start on the descendant, which PostgreSQL serves out of
//! its own verbatim copy of the ancestor prefix
//! (architecture/recovery.md).
//!
//! Advertising after the commit is load-bearing in both directions. Earlier and
//! the shadow is told about a fork whose floor still names the ancestor; later
//! and a client still reading the ancestor is handed a descendant record.
//!
//! Scope is operator-driven switchover: writes stop, every transaction
//! resolves, and no torn record survives, so the fence and the
//! overwrite-contrecord path are typed refusals rather than working paths
//! (plans/failover.md).
