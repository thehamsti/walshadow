# Select tables

Choose broad automatic scope or explicit table scope. Exclusions always win
over broad patterns

Every selected table needs one of:

- primary key with default replica identity
- unique index selected by `REPLICA IDENTITY USING INDEX`
- `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`

Tables with `REPLICA IDENTITY NOTHING`, or default identity without a primary
key, cannot replicate deletes correctly and fail preflight

## Replicate all user tables

`replicate_all` defaults to `true`. It covers current and future user tables,
excluding `pg_*`, `information_schema`, and configured runtime-config schema.
`walshadow-stream init` writes no `[stream]` block, so config it writes starts
in this mode whichever tables you chose

```toml
[stream]
replicate_all = true

[table.public.audit_log]
replicate = false
```

Use this mode to replicate all tables by default. It covers the source database
`dbname` in `[source]` names; entries prefixed with another database name bring
that database in too, see [several databases](multi-database.md)

## Replicate an explicit set

Disable broad scope, then opt tables in. `replicate_all` is startup-only, so
change it in config file and restart daemon

```toml
[stream]
replicate_all = false

[table.public.orders]
replicate = true
initial_load = "copy"

[table.public.users]
replicate = true
initial_load = "copy"
```

Inspect and change scope while daemon runs:

```bash
walshadow-stream ctl tables
walshadow-stream ctl add public orders --initial-load copy
walshadow-stream ctl remove public audit_log
```

`ctl tables` marks replicated tables with `*`. `remove` stops future delivery
and retains destination table

## Choose initial load

Initial-load mode controls rows committed before table selection. It comes
from table block, `ctl add`, or config row. Table which reaches scope through
`replicate_all` alone gets no initial load: destination table auto-creates and
receives changes from start LSN onwards

| Mode | Existing rows | Source impact | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | skipped | none | destination already has baseline, or only future changes matter |
| `copy` | read with live SQL snapshot | table scan | normal table additions |
| `base_backup` | read from fresh physical backup | cluster-sized backup stream | SQL scan pressure is undesirable |
| `object_store` | read from latest wal-g backup plus archived WAL | archive reads | continuous compatible backup archive exists |

`walshadow-stream init` defaults to `--initial-load copy`. This mode scans only
selected table through PostgreSQL, which supplies visible rows and detoasted
values. Choose `--initial-load base_backup` or `--initial-load object_store`
to load existing rows from physical data

`base_backup` streams whole PostgreSQL cluster even when adding one table
because PostgreSQL backup protocol has no per-table filter

`object_store` requires `[backup]` configuration, full wal-g backup, and
continuous archived WAL coverage. Use `copy` when backup predates incompatible
schema changes or archive coverage has gaps

Backup modes resolve mapped external TOAST values from walked chunk mirrors.
Missing chunks or multixact visibility that backup cannot resolve stop the load;
retry with a fresher backup or explicitly select `copy`. Source SQL queries still
supply metadata and control replication. See
[initial-load limits](limitations.md#initial-loads)

## Select future tables by name

Use anchored glob or regular-expression rules

```toml
[stream]
replicate_all = false

[table.app."events_*"]
match = "glob"
replicate = true
initial_load = "copy"

[table.app."*_audit"]
match = "glob"
replicate = false
```

Supported match modes:

- `exact`, literal name and default mode
- `glob`, supports `*`, `?`, character classes, and choices
- `regex`, supports regular expressions without backreferences

Patterns match whole names. Exact entries apply after patterns. Explicit exact
entry can override pattern result, while matching exclusion blocks broader
opt-ins

## Rename targets or columns

Map one table without pinning source shape:

```toml
[table.app.orders]
replicate = true
target_database = "warehouse"
target_table = "fact_orders"
columns = [
    { name = "customer_id", target = "account_id" },
    { name = "created_at", type = "DateTime64(6, 'UTC')" },
]
```

Name-based entries preserve automatic schema discovery. Each may override
ClickHouse name, type, or both

Use name patterns for type families:

```toml
[table.app."*"]
match = "glob"
replicate = true
columns = [
    { name = "*_at", match = "glob", type = "DateTime64(6, 'UTC')" },
]
```

Avoid `attnum` mappings unless destination projection must stay fixed. An
`attnum` mapping pins full projection, requires explicit ClickHouse names and
types, and will not automatically include unrelated source columns
